## Unity Test Framework
# define unit specific testing files here which will be compiled and executed first.
# These tests should be executed each build and only if they pass should the rest of build continue.

# we want to output the results of the test run to a file - if it passed, we can make a file:
# TIMER_RP2040_TEST.passed
# TIMER_RP2040_TEST.failed
# Then this file is used as a target of the overall build. If that file doesnt exist, we continue with
# tests but will fail for the overall app compilation.

# is there value for making a makefile for single module testing? Yes. Should we do that first? Yes.


#This file defines the test executable that must be run.
